1. Code Base Organization:

the solution code is organized chronologically. the order is:

 a. Data visualization (Plotting graphs to view dataset trend)
 b. Data Preprocessing, (making necessary changes and splitting dataset to train and test in 80:20 fashion)
 c. Running training models:
       Decision Tree , Logistic Regression , Support Vector Machine , Naive Bayes ,Random Forest ,MLP

 d. Comparing the accuracy, precision, recall of the training models and plotting comparison charts

2. Commands to Run:

   keep the dataset and python solution in the same directory

   Run "python solution_stage5.py"
